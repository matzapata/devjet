Use `:param` syntax in your route path and useParams() to read them:

```tsx {2,8,15,16}
import React from "react";
import { Routes, Route, useParams } from "react-router-dom";

function App() {
    return (
    <Routes>
      <Route
        path="invoices/:invoiceId"
        element={<Invoice />}
      />
    </Routes>
  );
}

function Invoice() {
  let params = useParams();
  return <h1>Invoice {params.invoiceId}</h1>;
}
```

Note that the path segment `:invoiceId` and the param's key `params.invoiceId` match up.

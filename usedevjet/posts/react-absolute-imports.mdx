With usedevjet react boilerplate you can use absolute imports by default. This is posible thanks to:

```json:tsconfig.json {4,7}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...,
    "baseUrl": "src"
  },
  "include": [
    "src"
  ]
}
```

This means that, for example, you can use `redux/stores.ts` instead of `../../../redux/stores.ts`. Access all folders from `src` without relative paths.

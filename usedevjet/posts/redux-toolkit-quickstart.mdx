Redux helps you with your app global state management.

1. Create a redux state slice at the `client/src/redux/slices` folder. If this is your first slice you can already delete the `.gitignore` file. Inside that folder create a file with your slice name, for this case `counterSlice.ts`. Insede of it define your initialState along with it's typescript type definition. Then use the `createSlice` function to define your slice name, initialState and reducers.

```ts:counterSlice.ts 
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import type { PayloadAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

export interface CounterState {
  value: number
}

const initialState: CounterState = {
  value: 0,
}

export const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.value += 1
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1
    },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action: PayloadAction<number>) => {
      state.value += action.payload
    },
  },
})

// Action creators are generated for each case reducer function
export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions

export default counterSlice.reducer
```

> Redux Toolkit allows us to write "mutating" logic in reducers. It doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library, which detects changes to a "draft state" and produces a brand new immutable state based off those changes.

2. Add slice reducers to the store

```ts:redux/store.ts {3,7}
import { TypedUseSelectorHook, useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "redux/slices/counter";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
  },
});

export type RootState = ReturnType<typeof store.getState>;
export type AppDispatch = typeof store.dispatch;
export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector;
export const useAppDispatch = () => useDispatch<AppDispatch>();
```

3. Use Redux State and Actions in React Components

```tsx {2,6,7,13,17,20}
import React from 'react'
import { decrement, increment, useAppSelector, useAppDispatch } from 'redux/slices/counter'
import { Box, Button, Text } from "@chakra-ui/react"

export function Counter() {
  const count = useAppSelector((state) => state.counter.value)
  const dispatch = useAppDispatch()

  return (
    <Box>
        <Button
          aria-label="Increment value"
          onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}
        >
          Increment
        </Button>
        <Text>{count}</Text>
        <Button
          aria-label="Decrement value"
          onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}
        >
          Decrement
        </Button>
    </Box>
  )
}
```

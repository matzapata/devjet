With usedevjet pern boilerplate you can use absolute imports by default in yout react client aplication. We've acomplished this by configuring tsconfig `baseUrl`.

```json:tsconfig.json {4,7}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...,
    "baseUrl": "src"
  },
  "include": [
    "src"
  ]
}
```

This means you can use `redux/stores.ts` instead of `../../../redux/stores.ts` for example. Access all folders from `src` without relative paths.

Use `Link` to let the user change the URL.

```tsx {1,8,9}
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Home</h1>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link> |{" "}
        <Link to="about">About</Link>
      </nav>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Or `useNavigate` to do it yourself (like after form submissions):

```tsx {1,4,9}
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

function Invoices() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  return (
    <NewInvoiceForm
      onSubmit={async (event) => {
        const newInvoice = await createInvoice(event.target);
        navigate(`/invoices/${newInvoice.id}`);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

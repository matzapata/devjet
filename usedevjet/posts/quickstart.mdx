## Tech stack

All devjet posts work with the same tech stack and folder structure, that's why it's importante that you get confident with the tech stack used throuout. The good part is that once you can position yourself in the base, you'll be capable of building anything you want in no time with devjet help.

The tech stack used is:

- React: Frontend framework.
- Typescript: Type checking in Backend as well as frontend.
- Eslint: Code formatting with prettier.
- Express: Backend framework.
- Prisma: ORM.
- Supabase: For authentication and database hosting.
- Chakra UI: UI components and styling made easy.
- Redux with redux-toolkit: State management.
- React router
- Vercel: Front and backend deployment

Some other services may be opted on receipes themselves to build different functionalities for your app like stripe for payments or postmark for emails.

## Create your first project and get started using devjet receipes

In order to get you started easily, we've created a CLI tool that you'll use frecuently along with the code receipes provided.

Install `devjet` CLI 

```
npm install -g devjet
devjet init my-pern-project
```

Or directly create your project with 

```
npx devjet init my-pern-project
```

That's it. Now navigate into de project folder and install the dependencies. 

```
cd my-pern-project
cd api && npm install
cd ../client && npm install
```

You can already get started working with your cliente application. 
For your backend there are still a couple of settings we have to do like creating a postgress database for local development and configuring enviroment variables.

Let's first setup our enviroment variables. In order to do that copy your `api/.env.example` file to `api/.env`.

Now we have to create a postgress database to work locally.

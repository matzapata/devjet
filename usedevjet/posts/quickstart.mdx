## Tech stack

When using devjet, you can choose to work with two boilerplates, React SPA with optional serverless functions by vercel and Nextjs. The best part is that if you use our boilerplates with `devjet new projectname --stack` you'll be in position of using our generators as well to improve your coding speed. Plus, all receipes will be in sync. 

The React tech stack used is:

- React: Frontend framework.
- Typescript: Type checking in Backend as well as frontend.
- Eslint: Code formatting with prettier.
- Serverless api funtions by vercel on `api` folder.
- Prisma: ORM.
- Chakra UI: UI components and styling made easy.
- Redux with redux-toolkit: State management.
- React router.

The NEXTJS tech stack used is:

- Next.js: Frontend framework and api routes.
- Typescript: Type checking in Backend as well as frontend.
- Eslint: Code formatting with prettier.
- Prisma: ORM.
- Chakra UI: UI components and styling made easy.
- Redux with redux-toolkit: State management.

Some other services may be opted on receipes themselves to build different functionalities for your app like stripe for payments or postmark for emails.

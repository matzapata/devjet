## Tech stack

Devjet by default makes use of two tech stacks, PERN and NEXTJS. The best way to maximize the value that you get from us is by using the `devjet` generators to boostrap your project. Otherwise you have to figure out how our receipes fit in your current work.

The PERN tech stack used is:

- React: Frontend framework.
- Typescript: Type checking in Backend as well as frontend.
- Eslint: Code formatting with prettier.
- Express: Backend framework.
- Prisma: ORM.
- Supabase: For authentication and database hosting.
- Chakra UI: UI components and styling made easy.
- Redux with redux-toolkit: State management.
- React router

The NEXTJS tech stack used is:

- Next.js: Frontend framework and api routes.
- Typescript: Type checking in Backend as well as frontend.
- Eslint: Code formatting with prettier.
- Prisma: ORM.
- Supabase: For authentication and database hosting.
- Chakra UI: UI components and styling made easy.
- Redux with redux-toolkit: State management.

Some other services may be opted on receipes themselves to build different functionalities for your app like stripe for payments or postmark for emails.

## PERN quickstart

1. Create your project base and install dependencies

```
npx devjet new my-pern-project --pern
```

That's it. Now navigate into de project folder and install the dependencies. 

```
cd my-pern-project
cd api && npm install
cd ../client && npm install
```

2. Setup your enviroment variables

Copy `api/.env.example` file to `api/.env` and `client/.env.example` to `client/.env` then fill with the necesary values.

3. Create a postgress database (you'll need to have postgress already installed on your device)

```
psql
> password: _ 

# create database my-pern-project;
# \q
```

4. Set your postgress url on the `api/.env` file


## NEXTJS quickstart

1. Create your project base and install dependencies

```
npx devjet new my-nextjs-project --nextjs
```

That's it. Now navigate into de project folder and install the dependencies. 

```
cd my-netjs-project && npm install
```

2. Setup your enviroment variables

Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and `.env.example` to `.env` then fill with the necesary values.

3. Create a postgress database (you'll need to have postgress already installed on your device)

```
psql
> password: _ 

# create database my-pern-project;
# \q
```

4. Set your postgress url on the `.env.local` file
